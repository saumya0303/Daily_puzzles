 How many places are there on the Earth where you can walk one mile south,
 one mile east, one mile north, and end up exactly where you started?
 Assume the Earth is a perfect sphere, that your compass bearing is constant on each leg of the walk, 
 that all parts of the Earth are able to be walked upon, and that your feet are arbitrarily small.
