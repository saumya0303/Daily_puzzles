1)You are dealt exactly two playing cards from a well-shuffled standard 52-card deck.
The standard deck contains exactly four Kings. What is the probability that both of your cards are Kings?

2)You and I are to play a game. You roll a die until a number other than a one appears. When such a number appears for the first time, 
I pay you the same number of dollars as there are dots on the upturned face of the die, and the game ends. "What is the expected payoff to this game?
